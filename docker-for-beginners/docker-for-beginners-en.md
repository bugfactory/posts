# Docker for Beginners

![alt tag](https://github.com/bugfactory/posts/blob/master/docker-for-beginners/imgs/docker.png)

Nowadays there is a lot of talk around docker in the geek world, indeed, 
this technology is increasing and every day new companies are embrancing it.
Docker became almost a required knowledge for developers and sysadmins.

Thinking about it, we want to create a sequence of posts to try to cover
the subject in the best way. In this first post we would like to answer the basic
questions, showing the main concepts, how to install and administrate a docker environment.

I hope you enjoy the content of this text and if you have questions, sugestions or complains,
just leave a comment and we’ll try to answer as soon as possible.

## Basic Concepts

Before we start talking about Docker we have to keep in mind two basic concepts: 
Linux Containers (LXC) and Virtual Machines (VMs). They always appear in papers related to docker.

Technology companies started adopting virtual machines a long time ago and I believe that
is not a new concept for you. But what is LXC? What is the difference between virtual machines and linux containers?

LXC is a virtualization in operating system level, it is used to run multiple isolated Linux systems,
it makes use of kernel features such as cgroups and namespaces. These isolated environments are known
as containers. The kernel cgroups feature allows resource sharing such as: CPU, memory and network.
The namespace creates an isolation for containers, in other words it ensures that a container can’t
see or impact another.

When we build a virtual machine we have a complete system, with its own libraries, kernel and binary.
It means that we have a copy of a isolated physical machine. However LXC works in a different way,
because it uses the hosts’ resource, such as: libs, kernel and binaries. As a result, to build a container
is faster, and lighter than a virtual machine.

The concept of cgroups and namespaces is much more complex than mentioned above. But our purpose is not
to go deeper in these concepts, but rather show docker tool, which uses both features. If you have
curiosity to know more about these them, a quick search on the internet will bring you great papers.

## A bit of history

The Docker development started by Solomon Hykes and others engineers at dotCloud. At the beginning it
was just an internal project to handle Linux Containers (LXC), then the developers realized the power
they had in hand and they decided to open the project.

So, what is docker? “Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that 
contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything you
can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the 
environment it is running in.” (docker.com)

Although in the begging Docker used to make use of LXC to access the kernel’s virtualization features,
since version 0.9, the tool uses libcontainer library which was developed by Docker company using Go
language to do the same. Also Docker is still compatible with other interfaces (libvirt, LXC,
systemd-nspwan). As shown in the figure below.

## Docker Container

Every Docker Container is built from an image, and its life cycle consists in the execution of a process,
thus while this process is running, the container also will run.

One container can run more than one process, but it isn’t a good practice. This concept is important to
understand how to “Dockerize” your application.

[“In almost all cases, you should only run a single process in a single container. Decoupling applications
into multiple containers makes it much easier to scale horizontally and reuse containers. If that service
depends on another service, make use of container linking.”](https://docs.docker.com/articles/dockerfile_best-practices/)

## Docker Image

They are read-only templates used to build containers. For instance, an Image would be the
operational system ubuntu with a web server installed. The Image is characterized as read-only
because from the moment you change it, it becomes another image. This concept will be more
easily to understand when we start using Docker in the command line.

## Docker Registry and Docker Hub

Imagine the following scenario: you work as a sysadmin in a company that is adopting Docker technology.
Inside this environment, developers want to manipulate and share many images, based in different
distributions and running different applications. They are creating new images and updating the ones
that already exist all the time. Also, these images must be private. How to manage such task?

That is the reason docker registry exists, it is an open source project which allows you to save,
share and manage your images in docker (in-house registry).

Docker Company provides a service of public registration, where users are able to save their images,
known as Docker Hub. Further we will show how to download, change and publish an image in docker hub,
but first you have to be registered into it.

## How to install

To install it is not complicated, and it is possible to find a variety of articles teaching how 
to do it in the distribuition you like the most. Just be aware of the requeriments, such as:

 - 64-bit installation regardless of your distribution version
 - kernel must be 3.10 at minimum

The linux distribution used in this post was ubuntu 14.10. If you have an old kernel version I
advise you to read at docker website.

To install docker we will need curl package.

```
$ sudo apt-get install curl
```

Now we can install Docker.

```
$ curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ |sh
```

We will see this message when we finished docker installation: *“If you would like to use Docker as a
non-root user, you should now consider adding your user to the "docker" group with something like”.*

```
$ usermod -aG docker <YOUR-USERNAME>
```

Remember that you will have to log out and back in for this to take effect!

Docker offers one test image that can be used to verify if the installation happened correctly.
The name of it could not be different, “hello-world”. When you execute the command below you
will be downloading the image and executing it in one container. 

```
$ docker run hello-world
```

## Starting with Docker

Sfter the download you probably have only the test image hello-world installed in you computer.
With the command docker images you can see your images.

```
$ docker images

REPOSITORY        TAG        IMAGE ID          CREATED       VIRTUAL SIZE
hello-world     latest     af340544ed62      2 weeks ago       960 B
```

To download another image you can use the command pull.

```
$ docker pull centos

Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/centos
f1b10cd84249: Pull complete 
c852f6d61e65: Pull complete 
7322fbe74aa5: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:90305c9112250c7e3746425477f1c4ef112b03b4abe78c612e092037bfecc3b7
Status: Downloaded newer image for centos:latest
```

Now if you execute the command docker image again, it will be possible to see the new
image that we downloaded from centos.

```
$ docker images

REPOSITORY        TAG        IMAGE ID          CREATED       VIRTUAL SIZE
hello-world     latest     af340544ed62      2 weeks ago       960 B
centos          latest     7322fbe74aa5      9 weeks ago       172.2 MB
```

To execute a container with an image is necessary to use the command run, and if this image
do not exist in your computer, docker will download it automatically for you.

The command below will build and execute a container with debian image. The options “i” and “t” are
usually combined to execute a process in an interactive way, like it was a shell.

```
$ docker run -i -t debian:8 /bin/bash
```

The command docker ps allows you to see all the containers that are running.

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID    IMAGE     COMMAND      CREATED   STATUS   PORTS      NAMES
cf52245c4c32   debian:8  "/bin/bash"  5 min ago  Up 5 min      desperate_mccarthy 
```

To make a container to stop running the command stop is used, it is necessary to say the
cointainer’s ID. Notice on the docker ps command there is a column called CONTAINER ID. 

```
$ docker stop cf52245c4c32
cf52245c4c32
```

If a stop command exists, a start command does as well, right?

```
$ docker start cf52245c4c32
cf52245c4c32
```

Now that our container is up again, it is possible to connect to it using `attach` command.

```
$ docker attach cf52245c4c32
root@cf52245c4c32:/# 
```

If you don’t want an image anymore, it is possible to remove an image using `rmi` command.

```
$ docker rmi -f <IMAGE-ID>
```

Remember, your best friend is the help command.

```
$ docker <COMMAND> help
```

## Publishing your images

Until now we used images available at docker hub. It is time to learn how to change,
commit and publish an image. Just to remind, you have to be registered at docker hub.

Let’s download ubuntu image and install nginx.

```
$ docker run -i -t ubuntu:14.10 /bin/bash
root@281b3fcf24f2:/# apt-get update
root@281b3fcf24f2:/# apt-get install nginx
```

We can verify the image changes using `diff` command. To leave the container
without killing it you have to press: **ctrl + p + q**. Using command `ps` we can 
see the container that is still running.

```
$ docker diff 281b3fcf24f2
```

The command result will show us everything we changed, add or removed. To save this
modifications in the image we have to use the `commit` command.

```
$ docker commit b15765f0448b patito/ubuntu-nginx
6b5522a3b94dcd25d3b4afb84b5069008bc69643fc69fae9ea6254be909c904e
```

Let’s login at docker hub.

```
$ docker login
Username: 
Password: 
Email: benatto@gmail.com
WARNING: login credentials saved in /home/patito/.docker/config.json
Login Succeeded
```

Our changes have been saved at patito/ubuntu-nginx. Let’s run this image and export port 80.
The port 8080 will be running at the host and the port 80 will be running at the container.
Remember to start nginx.

```
$ docker run -i -t -p 8080:80 patito/ubuntu-nginx /bin/bash
root@68246cddc002:/# service nginx start
root@68246cddc002:/# ps aux
```

With the command ps aux in the container you will verify if the nginx is running. 
If everything happened normally you can access your browser http://<IP-ADDRESS>:8080.
You should access the page of welcome to nginx.

![alt tag](https://github.com/bugfactory/posts/blob/master/docker-for-beginners/imgs/nginx.png)

```
$ docker push patito/ubuntu-nginx
```

You can login at docker hub and see your new image.

![alt tag](https://github.com/bugfactory/posts/blob/master/docker-for-beginners/imgs/ubuntu-nginx.png)

If you want to search images at docker hub, you can use command `search`.

```
$ docker search centos
```

To do the logout from docker hub use the `logout` command.

```
$ docker logout
Remove login credentials for https://index.docker.io/v1/
```
